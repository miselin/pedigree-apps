Pedigree UPdater
================

pup provides Pedigree with package management in a way that works for both cross
compilation and installation on Pedigree proper.

The pup tool allows for package creation, registering of packages with
repository databases, synchronisation of repository databases to the local host,
and installation of packages based on the metadata in a repository database.
