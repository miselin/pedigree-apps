PEDIGREE-APPS README
====================

NOTE: Preliminary documentation, some features may not yet exist.

The purpose for the Pedigree-Apps subproject is mainly to provide a central
location for all files and folders relating to installable applications.

A cron job runs on this repository nightly, running any PKGBUILDs it finds
to add to the pedigree-project.org Pacman mirror.

If working on Pedigree, you can use this set of directories to populate your
images/<target arch>-elf directory with the set of applications you require
for your testing.

When creating a package, your directory structure should reflect the following
outline (using lynx as an example):

- i686
  - lynx
    - 2.8.7
      - PKGBUILD
      - root
        - applications
          - lynx
        - config
          - lynx
            - lynx.cfg
            - lynx.lss

The "root" directory is effectively the same as "/" when running Pedigree.
